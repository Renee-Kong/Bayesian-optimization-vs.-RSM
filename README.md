# ðŸ“˜ BO vs. RSM: Optimization of Plant-Based Protein Extrusion

## Overview
This repository contains code for comparing **Bayesian Optimization (BO)** and **Response Surface Methodology (RSM)** in optimizing the mechanical properties of plant-based meat analogues produced by high-moisture extrusion. The goal is to identify optimal processing conditions that yield extrudates with desirable textural attributes, particularly mimicking chicken breast.

## Project Goals
- Compare BO and RSM frameworks for black-box optimization.
- Visualize and compare optimization paths, performance, and outcomes.
- Evaluate convergence, sample efficiency, and prediction accuracy.
